    "## Fire Resistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fire resistant plasterboard**, commonly known as **fireproof plasterboard**, is quite self-explanatory. The boards can be used for both walls and ceilings. \n",
    "\n",
    "These plasterboards benefit greatly from **enhanced fireproof qualities** that have been added to the board. The **British Gypsum Fireline** square edge plasterboard consists of an aerated core with glass fibres and other insulant material additives encased in the strong paper liners. This board is best suited for dry lining internal surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **fire resistance performance** of plasterboard is based on several building ‘elements’. These elements include walls, floors, ceilings and partitions. Plasterboard in this instance only forms part of these overall constructions. **HTM05** and **BB100** documents require a minimum period of fire resistance provided by these ‘elements’.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter the ‘element’, the linings in the plasterboard will have metal studs and screw fixings which also make up the whole ‘system’ of fire resistance performance. All components make up the performance (expressed in periods of **resistance** in **minutes** – usually from **30-120**). Plasterboard cannot be considered fire resistant on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **fire rated plasterboard sheets** come in widths of either **12.5mm** or **15mm** and are available in **tapered edge** or **square edge** styles. The latter thickness is ideal for walls and partitioning where a more robust barricade with fire protection is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we strongly recommend getting in touch directly prior to ordering square edge boards, due to minimal stock levels around the country, and that square edge is significantly less popular than tapered edge for fire protection projects. Be advised that square edge fire retardant plasterboard will take a few extra days to be delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition fire testing is carried out in accordance with **BS476**. "

    "## Fire Protection Boards\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire, like air and water is very useful for us, but the devastation fire causes can be catastrophic. Special types of fire resistant boards are created to safeguard your building from fire hazard. This is called the passive fire protection. The aim of of passive fire protection system is to contain the fire by delaying the growth of the fire and to prevent the fire and smoke from moving from one compartment to another and to delay the collapse of the building structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire protection boards are made from Calcium Silicate, Gypsum, and Mineral Fibre with special additives to suppress the growth of fire. These boards have excellent stability, are easily installed, have fire performance and finish in one and have up to 240 minutes fire performance. Some of these boards have moisture resistance additives in them, so they can be installed in areas, where there is a chance of exposure to moisture or water. The fire protection boards are also used in industrial, commercial and public areas, such as factories, duct work, steel structures, smoke barriers, tunnels, airports. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good building is a safe building. Fire safety of a building is very important and all buildings have to meet the legislation regarding fire-safe construction, so using superior quality fire protection materials is crucial. During a fire, fire rated constructions allow people to reach safety. The manufacturers of specialised fire protection boards test them thoroughly. Carefully selected fire protection boards are available at Insulationshop.co.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fire protection testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaction to Fire - tests how a product will become involved in the growth of fire at origin, up to the time when flashover--near-simultaneous ignition of the material directly exposed to fire--occurs, or does not occur, and provides a fire classification for the material.\n",
    "Fire resistance - tests how an element of construction or fire protection system will prevent a fully developed fire from causing structural collapse of the element, or prevent the fire from passing from origin into an adjacent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tests on materials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-combustibility test for materials: BS 476: Part 4: 1970 - This test classifies materials as either non-combustible or combustible. It is standard for the fire performance of materials and gives a measure of the heat and flames generated by the material under standard heating conditions. Non-combustible materials can be used without restriction anywhere in a building, as their use ensures that hazards due to smoke and toxic gases are minimised and that the fabric of a building will not contribute to creating a fire. \n",
    "Method of test for fire propagation for products: BS 476: Part 6: 1989 - This test measures the amount and rate of heat evolved by the product while subjected to standard heating conditions. \n",
    "Method for classification of the surface spread of flame for products: BS 476: Part 7: 1987 - This test classifies materials into Classes 1 to 4 in descending order of performance according to the rate and extent of flame spread over their surface under standard heating conditions. Class 1 is the highest. \n",
    "Method of assessing the heat emissions from building materials: BS 476: Part 11: 1982 - This is method for assessing the heat emissions from building materials at a temperature of 750C. Class 0 - Composed throughout of materials of limited combustibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire performance of the material is tested on,\n",
    "* its ability support its loadbearing capacity without deformation,\n",
    "* its integrity against collapsing, freedom from holes, cracks and fissures and sustained flaming on the unexposed face,\n",
    "* its ability to restrict the temperature rise of the unexposed face to below specified levels (usually 140C mean rise, 180C maximum rise),\n",
    "* its ability to maintain its intended function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Application\n",
    "* Partitions,\n",
    "* Ceilings,\n",
    "* Wall and roof linings,\n",
    "* Door upgrades,\n",
    "* Porch or canopy linings,\n",
    "* Service enclosures and pipe covers,\n",
    "* Boiler and airing cupboard linings,\n",
